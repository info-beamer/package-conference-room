= Conference Room Information

{{example.jpg|Screenshot}}

= Description

Displays information about the next talk, talks in other rooms and generic room information.
Scheduling information is imported from a https://frab.cccv.de/ export.

= Configuration

== Logo (logo)

Sets a logo. Size should be 280x100 pixel. Otherwise the image will be scaled to that size which 
might lead to a reduced quality.

== Other room display (other_rooms)

How long to show information about talks in other rooms (in seconds)

== Current room (current_room)

How long to show information about the (upcoming) talk in the current room.
Default is 15 seconds.

The current talk is displayed for the first 25 minutes of that talk. So in
case of a delayed start the screen will stil show useful information.

After 25 minutes into the talk this screen will show information about the
next talk.

== Room info (room_info)

Shows information about the current room (irc channel, recommended hashtag).

== Schedule URL (schedule_url) 

Url where the running devices should fetch the schedule from. The schedule
is expected to be in the frabs export format. This format looks something
like this:

{{{
<schedule>
    <conference>
        <title>EuroPython 2014</title>
        <acronym>EP2014</acronym>
        <start>2014-07-21</start>
        <end>2014-07-27</end>
        <days>7</days>
        <timeslot_duration>00:15</timeslot_duration>
    </conference>
    <day date="2014-07-21" index="1">
        <room name="C01">
        <event id="118">
    ...
</schedule>
}}}

rooms.

== Transitioning to other packages

This package is obsolete now as this package didn't really integrate into any
other packages. The Schedule Player package offers a better option to show
frab conference data and you can freely mix it with other content. Have a look at:
